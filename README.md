# hello-world
my first repository
Hello Folks
This is my first real effort at github.  I would like to become a productive Python developer.  I have coded a couple of projects but compared to whatI have foundin other places such as Real Python, I have aa lot to learn.
I havee a BS in Cheniistry and M with work in other areas.  Most of my fomal college work was over in about 1983.  I have done online schooling in Python an HTML, so you might call me an ambitious retired guy.
